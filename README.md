# Gse27342_GeneExpression_CMap_Analysis
Analysis of gene expression data (microarray, GSE27342) to identify differentially expressed genes between tumor and normal tissue. Further use the differentially expressed genes (DEG) to identify potential therapeutic compounds  using Connectivity Map (CMap).
